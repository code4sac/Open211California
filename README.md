# Open211California
Research and data for accessing California county systems' 211 information

#Help build out the list in the Wiki!  
We're gathering data on each 211 system in California, so we can see what benefits Californians can derive from 211 systems supporting Open Data.

Navigate to the wiki in this project, and edit the main page of 211 county systems.   Browse the web, make calls, get involved!

Let's ask:  If taxpayers fund the building and maintenance of this data, should we not have easy access to the contents?  Content access gives community efforts such as SacSOS and others the ability to innovate new solutions for communities in need, using means not otherwise available.  Open access can also allow reporting on where services are or are not available, roll-up reporting for tracking growth and shrinkage of resources, and analysis of the health of our communities, even relative to other communities.

If you have time on Open Data day, or after, go to our wiki and get involved!

Any time you want, feel free to fork this repository, and/or the wiki repository, for your own purposes.   And if you think there are other columns of data to be reported on, Add it!  Let's do this!

Thanks,
